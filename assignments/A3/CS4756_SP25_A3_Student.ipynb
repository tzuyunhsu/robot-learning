        "\n",
        "Concretely, you will:\n",
        "* Implement the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm (Part 1)\n",
        "* Implement the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm (Part 2)\n",
        "* CS5756 Only: Implement the Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm (Part 3)\n",

        "You will use the FetchReach-v4 environments for this assignment. Refer to the Gymnasium-Robotics website for more details about [this environment](https://robotics.farama.org/envs/fetch/).\n",

        "Please read through the following paragraphs carefully.\n",

        "**Getting Started:** You should complete this assignment on **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evaluation:**\n",
        "Your code will be tested for correctness and, for certain assignments, speed. For this particular assignment, performance results will not be harshly graded (although we provide approximate expected reward numbers, you are not expected to replicate them exactly). Please remember that all assignments should be completed individually.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Academic Integrity:** We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else’s code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don’t try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don’t let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.\n",

        "**Getting Help:** The [Resources](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4756/2025sp/#resources) section on the course website is your friend! If you ever feel stuck in these projects, please feel free to avail yourself to office hours and Edstem! If you are unable to make any of the office hours listed, please let TAs know and we will be happy to assist. If you need a refresher for PyTorch, please see this [60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)!

        "In this part of the assignment, we will implement a version of the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm. This algorithm is an extension to the REINFORCE algorithm, and it combines both value-based and policy-based methods. **See MACRL 11.8 for more information on Actor-Critic methods.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The A2C algorithm reduces the variance of the model by subtracting a baseline from the sum of rewards. This modifies our original objective function as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ J(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}}[r(\\tau) - b] $$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $b$ is the baseline.\n",
        "\n",
        "In A2C, there is both a policy network $\\pi_{\\theta}$ (actor network) and a value network $V_ϕ$ (critic network). The policy network is used to select actions, while the value network is used to estimate the value of a state. The value network will be used to compute the baseline $b$ in A2C.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, using $V_{\\phi}(s_t)$ as the baseline, and using (discounted) reward-to-go in place of total reward (as done in part 2), A2C approximates $ \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$ as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}  \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \\nabla_\\theta log \\pi_\\theta(a_{it}|s_{it}) \\bigl(R_{it} - V_ϕ (s_{it}) \\bigl) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "This algorithm is called **Advantage** Actor-Critic because the quantity $R_t - V_ϕ (s_{t})$ is an approximation of what is known as the *advantage function* $A^{\\pi_{\\theta}}$:\n",

        "$$A^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s_t,a_t) = Q^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s_t,a_t) - V^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s_t) \\approx R_t - V_ϕ (s_t)$$\n",

        "Defining $\\tilde{A_t} = R_t - V_ϕ (s_t)$ to be the approximate advantage function, we have:\n",

        "\n",
        "For A2C, we have two loss functions: one for the policy network and one for the value network. The policy loss will be defined similarly to the loss in reward-to-go REINFORCE, replacing $R_t$ with $\\tilde{A_t}$ and additionally taking the average loss within each episode rather than using total loss (as is commonly done in practice):\n",
