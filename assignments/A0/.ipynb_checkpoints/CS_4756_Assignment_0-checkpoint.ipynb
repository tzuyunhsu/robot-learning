    "\n",
    "Welcome to Assignment 0 of 4756. In this short notebook, we hope to refresh your memory with common Numpy pain points and PyTorch. Please read through the following paragraphs carefully, as they will apply to this and all future assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:**\n",
    "Your code will be tested for correctness and, for certain assignments, speed. Please remember that all assignments should be completed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Academic Integrity:** We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else’s code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don’t try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don’t let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Help:** The [Resources](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4756/2024sp/#resources) section on the course website is your friend (especially for this first assignment)! If you ever feel stuck in these projects, please feel free to avail yourself to office hours and Edstem! If you are unable to make any of the office hours listed, please let TAs know and we will be happy to assist. Of course, Numpy and Python skills will also be implicitly tested via this assignment. If you need a refresher, please see this [60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) for PyTorch! For Numpy, please see the quickstart [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) and full API [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/). \n"

The bugs are also simple enough to be fixed in-line - you should not need to add many lines of code.\n",
